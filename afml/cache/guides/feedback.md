* Hello Patrick.
The main weaknesses of the article:
1. Excess of technical noise
The article looks like a mixture:
   * architecture manuals,
   * documentation,
   * advertising,
   * ML guide,
   * MQL5 guide.
This interferes with focusing.
2. There is no clear practical example
Although the article is long, it contains few specific cases such as:
   * "How Cache Reduced Strategy X Optimization Time from 6 Hours to 12 Minutes."
3. Heavy code dumps kill readability
Visually, the article is intimidating: a huge amount of code and ASCII diagrams.
4. The reader begins to drown after 20–30% of the article
Due to lack of rest and reframes.
5. There is no final block that answers the questions:
   * What should I do now?
   * How can you implement this into your pipeline tomorrow?
   * Where is the minimum example?

Every article should have 3 important components:
1. What will a trader come up before  reading this article - what problem does the trader have - point A (Beginning)
2. What will he leave with after reading the article - what will he get - point B (Conclusion).
3. How an article moves the reader from point A to point B - It is the topic of the article itself

FINAL CRITICISM A-B-TOPIC
| Component | Grade | Problems |
|-----------------|---------|-------------|
|Point A | 6/10 | Too technical, no human pain, no clear “why”. |
| Point B | 5/10 |There is no clear transformation, no concrete result for the reader. | 
| TOPIC | 7/10 | There is logic, but it is suppressed by a gigantic array of technical details. |
